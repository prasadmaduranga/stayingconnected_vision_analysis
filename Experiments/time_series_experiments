Highlights:



# Experiment 2:
 # 7001 , DW, efffeced, unefffeced
Highlights: no significant difference between the two groups in terms of the speed. Distriibution is also thee same
in terms of the grip aperture theree is a significant diffeerence. grip aperture distribution is high for unaffected hand
elbow speed: loweer distributiioon for affectd hand


 # Experiment 3:
 # all users , DW, , efffeced,unefffeced
 non affected hand always has higher grip aperture mean
