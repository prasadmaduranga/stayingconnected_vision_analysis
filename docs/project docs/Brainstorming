Features for our framework

add tags for a video: 

these are the feaures I need. Need more feaures n the future. but foor now create code fr only these features. 



 # RIGHT_WRIST_SPEED
 Speed of the RIGHT_WRIST landmark point. Compare two adjecent frames and get the eucledean distance. only consider x,y cooordinates 
time bettween ttwo frame can be based on the frame rate.


# RIGHT_ELBOW_SPEED
# RIGHT_SHOULDER_SPEED

# LEFT_WRIST_SPEED
# LEFT_ELBOW_SPEED
# LEFT_SHOULDER_SPEED

# HAND_BOUNDING_BOX_IOU
get the bounding box for left hand and right hand and left hand sperately. take the wrist and other joints of the palm n to consideration when defning the scope for the boundng box. then get the intersectoin over union value. 





need to add feature called HAND_BOUNDING_BOX_IOU
get the bounding box for left hand and right hand and left hand sperately. then get the intersectoin over union value. 

steps tto follow for defining a bounding box for the hand
for left hand: 
 get the featured of the palm of that particular hand : Wrist, and all fingerr joints
 consider their X,Y coordinates. out of the coordinates max X value, Max Y value, Min X value and min Y value. using these four values defin the four corners of bounding box

 similarly derive a bounding box for other hand as well.

 then calculate their interesection and union values in the carttesan plane. then calculate intersction over union
